_A random + classic Pomodoro timer for focus_

## üöÄ Aim & Purpose

Randoro is a simple, privacy-first **Pomodoro web app**.

- **Normal Mode**: classic 25/5 cycle with long breaks.

- **Task list**: up to 3 focus tasks with notes.
- **Custom alarm**: upload your own sound (saved locally in browser).
- **Reset option**: clear current session, timer, and tasks.
- Works offline and can be **installed as a PWA** (like a native app).

- **Storage**: IndexedDB (session + uploaded sounds + alarm), localStorage (settings, tasks)
  - **Persistent across page reloads & browser restarts**
  - Uploaded sounds are stored locally in IndexedDB
  - Clearing site data/cache will remove uploaded sounds
  - Supported on **Chrome, Firefox, Brave, Safari** (modern browsers)
